        <p><strong>Hado</strong> is a very sincere and loyal pet animal. He serves me master all the time. It has unique qualities of <em>loyalty, faithfulness, sincerity, wisdom and emotional attachment </em>with its master.

            The dog has been a partner of mankind since the ancient times. The dog is found everywhere around the world. There are hundreds of varieties of dogs. But each variety has one common thing that is sincerity and loyalty to the master.
            
            My family is very fond of dogs. There are few dogs of different varieties in my family. But among all these dogs Jackie is the name of my favorite dog. I have chose him because of his few distinct features. Jackie belongs to a famous dog breeds called Labrador retriever. Jackie is of full strong body with chocolate color having black stripe around its neck.
            Jackie is my favorite dog because he is loyal, sincere and he is greatly attached with its master. Jackie is easily teachable. In a very short period he has learned swimming, understanding and obeying my commands. He quickly picks up my orders and follows them immediately. Jackie is very safe dog.
            
            He is child friendly and always keeps your child entertained. He protects my house in my absence. He has very sharp ability to understand the potential danger ahead. In every morning Jackie wakes me up and we both go for a little walk. After that Jackie accompanies me to my school. He comes back on exact time when my school gets off.
            
            I really enjoy his sincerity, devotion and kindness. He is the best ever friend of mine.  Every member of my family loves him. Thatâ€™s why when Jackie becomes a little bit ill, we all become worried about him. Due to that fact, I always take care of Jackie. I give him fresh milk and fresh meat to make him healthy and strong always.</p>
